There was supposed to be a big push yesterday for Net Neutrality. In practice, Google posted a meager blog entry, and a few sites blurred some images. Similar to the grocer down the street adding “organic” to it’s name and selling the same old stuff.

It’s impossible to know how long the open web as we knew it will last, but clearly the situation is not improving. The head of the FCC is part of big telecom. Capital insanity is so ingrained in the culture. Filter bubbles. Fake news. It’s a trash fire, mostly. But, it’s not all bad.

Without getting into it; while blockchains are promising, their value is derived from imposed scarcity. Far more interesting are truly distributed systems, torrent-like, closely resembling the early days of the internet. All attempts at returning to a past ideal are unfounded, but there are a few possible futures that have me very excited.

I’m most hopeful of [Dat](http://datproject.org) and [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com). You can think of Dat like a mix of Dropbox and Github, but your files aren’t stored on corporate servers. Instead, they are transferred directly between those exchanging the files, with no middleman.

At first Dat was used to transfer large scientific datasets, but it happens to be a great way of distributing websites between peers. Beaker Browser uses Dat to let you self-publish online, save sites for offline, and re-host for others.

Both these projects have matured to a point that they can be immediately used.

So, this weekend, partly as my contribution to whatever the “Net Neutrality awareness” day was, I moved my personal site off of Amazon’s servers and onto Dat, a distributed peer-to-peer system.

You can visit my site now via:

## A quick intro

Since Dat is peer-to-peer, you may be wondering how to ensure it’s constantly accessible, or how to add a domain name. Basic.

Beaker has created a p2p host called [Hashbase](http://hashbase.io). All it requires is pasting the URL to a Dat Archive. You can [start today](https://hashbase.io/). You can also setup your own server with [dathttpd](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dathttpd) to manage your Dats and auto configure SSL. Going fully manual isn’t much work, too:

- Installing Dat on your server using `npm install dat -g`
- Cloning your site’s Dat Archive
- Configuring the Archive directory as your web root
- Adding Dat’s `sync` command to `systemctl`, or equivalent.

Doing this turns your site into a persistent peer, ensuring anyone can access your site anytime, either by visiting your domain, or using Beaker, or anything else using Dat.

## Data

Beaker also exposes interesting [Web APIs](https://beakerbrowser-com-pfrazee.hashbase.io/docs/apis/) to let you modify the contents of a Dat Archive. For instance, instead of storing user data in a proprietary database, you can write data to a Dat Archive, providing users autonomy and ownership.

Dat Archives also have built in version control. History, merging and reverting to previous versions of data are baked in.

## The future web

Observing the proliferation of machine learning, AI, and AR/VR in our daily lives, I can’t help but be excited of the technology, but increasingly anxious about who the technology will be serving, and what for.

Anyone working with the internet today has a responsibility to take time exploring distributed alternatives, and begin integrating them into their practices. Not only do they have an immediate impact and usefulness today, but will help to establish a habit of pragmatic skepticism in the tools we use in the future(s).
