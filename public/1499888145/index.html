      <p>There was supposed to be a big push yesterday for Net Neutrality. In pratice, Google posting a meager blog entry, and a few sites pixelated images. Does every little bit help, or does it become posturing? Similar to the grocer down the street adding “organic” to it’s name and selling the same old stuff.</p>

<p>It’s too late, probably. The internet, as it was, is over. Of course, it was over as soon as it began. This isn’t a bad thing, but it’s not returning. Not as long as cable companies are the ones who own the connections, or the head of the FCC comes from big telecom, or the capital insanity is so ingrained in the culture.</p>

<p>At this point, all these thoughts are tired to everyone, but are still relevant.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I’ve found it becoming difficult to feel as though my contributions online aren’t adding to the dumpster fire. Small gestures in the right direction have taken on new meaning, an encouraging thought, but also an exhausting one, when projects appear so rooted in opposition to increasingly insurmountable odds.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the open web isn’t entirely gone, yet, and we in the meantime can use it’s future shadow to build on.</p>

<p>Without getting into it; while blockchains are promising, their value is derived from the scarcity, reinforcing issues we all know. Far more interesting are truly distributed systems, like torrents, closely resembling the early days of the internet.</p>

<p>The projects I’m most hopeful of are <a href="http://datproject.org">Dat</a> and <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com">Beaker</a>.</p>
