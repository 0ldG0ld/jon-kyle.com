it’s my site. some interesting bits. it uses [choo v6](https://github.com/choojs/choo) as a little static site generator. it’s also hosted on the distributed web with [dat](http://datproject.org), [dathttpd](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dathttpd) and is also published to [hashbase](http://hashbase.io).

if you’d like, you can open any of the `dat://` links with [beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/), where you can fork the site and create your own version, choose to sync it for offline viewing, and help seed it to other visitors.

the distributed web is here :)
